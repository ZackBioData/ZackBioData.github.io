## Description
a
This section is part journal, part learning log. I’m using the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge to build consistent coding habits and sharpen my skills. Each entry will either be a quick write-up of what I’ve coded that day, or a summary of something I’ve read or practiced — all with a focus on clean, professional documentation.
