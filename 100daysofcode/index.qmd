## Description

This section is part journal, part learning log. Iâ€™m using the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge to build consistent coding habits and sharpen my skills. Each entry will either be a quick write-up of what Iâ€™ve coded that day, or a summary of something Iâ€™ve read or practiced â€” all with a focus on clean, professional documentation.
