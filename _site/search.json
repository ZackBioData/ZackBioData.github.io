Used ggsave(‚Äúfigures/Volcanoplot.jpg‚Äù) and made sure the folder path was right.\nPlots didn‚Äôt render in site ‚Üí wrong relative path. Switched to log/figures/ and renamed files cleanly.\nenrichplot::barplot() didn‚Äôt work ‚Üí Just use barplot() without enrichplot:: prefix.\nPNG wouldn‚Äôt load ‚Üí renamed .png and re-saved properly. Hosted on Imgur as backup.\nHad to clean probe ‚Üí gene symbol mapping ‚Üí mapIds() gave NAs. Filtered out before topTable / enrichment.\nSaved a bunch of useful code in .Rhistory ‚Äî rescued a lot from there when I thought it was lost."
