##  About

This log summarizes key insights from the webinar *Inside the Minds of Scientists: How AI is Changing Life Science Research*, hosted by **Bioinformatics** in May 2025.

##  Key Trends

- AI is moving from discovery to development.
- AI appears to be shifting from predictions to decisions â€” Y Combinator is investing heavily in companies fully run by AI agents.
- Pharma is integrating AI across more stages of R&D (e.g., target ID, trial design, decision-making).

##  What's Holding AI Back in Biology?

> Current issues with Ai in biosciences:

- **Reproducibility issues** â€” hard to trust models without transparent workflows.
- **Learning curve and training** â€” lack of experience with AI was a significant pain point for many users.


ðŸ’¬ *This resonated with me. Iâ€™ve already seen how messy biological data can be, which leads to a steep learning curve and difficulty managing AI outputs.*

##  Changes for future adoption

- Transparency is important for scientists to adopt and understand AI tools â€” they need to know how and what models were trained with.
- Tools need to be built with their actual users in mind â€” typically, biologists.
